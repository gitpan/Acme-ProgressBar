README for Acme::ProgressBar

 use Acme::ProgressBar;
 progress { do_something_slow };
 progress { unlink $_ for <*> };
 progress { while (<>) { $ua->get($_) } };
 progress { sleep 5; }

Acme::ProgressBar provides a simple solution designed to provide accurate
countdowns. No progress bar object needs to be created, and all the calculation
of progress through total time required is handled by the module itself.

There is only one function exported by default, progress. This function takes a
coderef as its lone argument. It will execute this code and display a simple
progress bar indicating the time required for ten iterations through the code
